<p>This additional milestone is named Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) and is defined as follows:</p>
<br>
<p>Simulated testing performed on the designed equipment following assembly of the equipment, where the </p>
<p>simulated testing is required to verify that the assembled equipment can operate at its design capacity and </p>

<p>and documentation and signed off by Alveo Energy’s responsible engineer. The Employer/Employers Agent is also </p>
<p>required to witness and sign-off the FAT certificate in order to confirm acceptance of the FAT.</p>
